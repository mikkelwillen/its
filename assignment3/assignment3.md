# Assignment 3

Due: see lecture plan

## SEED Lab

Complete Task 1, 2 and 4 in the SEED SQL Injection Attack Lab available at available at https://seedsecuritylabs.org/Labs_20.04/Web/Web_SQL_Injection/.

Describe your observations in a short report.

## Short answer questions

1. Define a buffer overflow attack.

2. List and briefly describe one or more defences against stack-based buffer overflows.

3. If a website only allows HTTP connections, is it more or less at risk from SQL injection attacks?

4. Suppose you find a vulnerability in the 'unzip' command on Unix that you can exploit to get a shell. You share your finding with your study companion who says that because the unzip program is owned by root, you can SSH into ssh.diku.dk and run your exploit to get a root shell. You disagree, arguing that running the command would give you a shell running with your privileges, not root privileges. Who is right, and why?
